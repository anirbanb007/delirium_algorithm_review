This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to support the analysis of studies related to delirium prediction and detection algorithms. Below is a brief description of each notebook:

1. Endnote XML to CSV
- Converts an Endnote-generated XML file into a structured DataFrame.
- Filters studies to include only those relevant to algorithm building for delirium prediction or detection.

2. PubMed Search and GenAI Selection
- Searches PubMed and creates a DataFrame of relevant studies.
- Utilizes Google GenAI to filter studies, retaining only those pertinent to delirium algorithm development.

3. Compare CSV for Duplicates
- Compares the CSV files generated by the above notebooks and identifies duplicate entries.

4. PDF Analysis to CSV and Graphs
- Analyzes full-text PDFs to answer specific yes/no questions using Google GenAI.
- Outputs results into a CSV file, where: Columns represent the questions & Rows represent the analyzed studies.
Processes the CSV to generate graphs and visualizations for manuscript preparation.

5. PDF Summary and Summary of Summaries
- Summarizes each paper individually, answering all questions and subquestions.
- Creates a "summary of summaries," aggregating results for specific questions across all papers.

Outputs
All notebooks save their respective outputs, including filtered DataFrames, analysis summaries, and visualizations, ensuring comprehensive documentation of the analysis process.
